# 👋 Hi, I'm Vadym Samardak

### Junior Frontend Developer | React | JavaScript | Linux & Docker Enthusiast

Frontend developer with practical experience in building responsive interfaces, working with React, and managing development environments on Linux and Docker.  
I enjoy creating clean, maintainable UI, experimenting with full-stack tools like Flask, and improving workflows through automation.  
My previous experience in system maintenance developed a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving habits, which I now apply to web development.
